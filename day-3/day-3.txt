1. Tuples

Ordered, immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

Can store duplicate


2. Sets

Unordered, unique elements only.

Very fast for membership tests (uses hashing internally).

No duplicates allowed.



3. Dictionaries

Key–value pairs.

Keys must be unique and hashable.

Very fast for searching by key (hashing).


Hashing Basics (Why Sets & Dicts are Fast)

Hashing = converting data (like a string "apple") into a unique number (hash value).

Sets and Dictionaries use hashing to quickly check membership or retrieve values.

That’s why:

x in set → O(1)

dict[key] → O(1)

x in list → O(n) (slower)
